#  Matrix Operations Program
This program performs various matrix operations on two user-inputted matrices. The available operations are:

- Addition of two matrices

- Subtraction of two matrices

- Multiplication of two matrices

- Matrix transposition (swap matrices A and B)

- Calculate the average of each row in both matrices

The program dynamically handles any matrix size (not restricted to 3x3) and performs the selected operation on the input matrices.

# Features

- Accepts matrix size and elements from the user

- Handles matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, and row-wise average calculations

- Interactive input for matrix values

- Shows results for each operation performed

# Getting Started
- Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/Papa_Cheems/Matrix-Operations.git`

- Compile and run the program using your preferred C compiler.

- Enter the number of rows and columns for the matrices when prompted, followed by their elements.

- Choose an operation (1-5) and see the results.
